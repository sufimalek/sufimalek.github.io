<!-- For Startups, Be Painkiller -->

The saying, 
> “Don’t be an Ayurveda medicine, be a pain killer,”
 
is a good analogy for the benefits of working quickly. Ayurveda medicine is often referred to as slow-acting and can take days or even weeks to produce results. Pain killers, on the other hand, are fast-acting and can provide relief from pain almost immediately. In the same way, working quickly can provide immediate results, while working slowly can take a long time to produce results.

> Example: Taking a turn slowly leads you to the next turn rather than your expected turn. 
{: .prompt-tip }

When you are driving, if you take a turn slowly, you are more likely to miss your turn and have to go around again. This can be frustrating and time-consuming. The same thing is true for work. If you take your time completing tasks, you are more likely to miss deadlines and have to work overtime.

In the context of a startup, it is important to be able to move quickly and efficiently. The market is constantly changing, and startups need to be able to adapt quickly in order to succeed. If a startup is too slow to react to changes in the market, it will be left behind by its competitors.

**Explanation:**

A startup that wants to provide results slowly will not be able to compete with startups that are able to provide results quickly. This is because customers and investors want to see results quickly. If a startup is not able to provide results quickly, it will be difficult for them to attract customers and investors.

Yes, startups need to be a painkiller and implement a solution as soon as possible before others do. This is because the market is constantly changing, and startups need to be able to adapt quickly in order to succeed. If a startup is too slow to react to changes in the market, it will be left behind by its competitors.

Here are some tips for implementing a solution quickly:

*   **Start small:** Don’t try to build the perfect solution right away. Start with a simple solution that can solve a small part of the problem. Once you have a working solution, you can iterate on it and improve it over time.
*   **Get feedback from users:** As you are developing your solution, get feedback from users. This will help you to identify any problems with your solution and make sure that it is meeting the needs of your users.
*   **Be agile:** Be willing to change your plans as you learn more about the problem and the market. Don’t be afraid to pivot if you need to.

If you can implement a solution quickly and effectively, you will be well on your way to building a successful startup.

Here are some reasons why startups need to be a painkiller:

*   **People are more likely to pay for something that solves a problem for them.** If a startup is not solving a problem, then it is going to be difficult to get people to pay for their product or service.
*   **People are more likely to talk about and recommend products or services that solve a problem for them.** If a startup is solving a problem, then people are more likely to tell their friends and colleagues about it. This can help the startup to grow its customer base.
*   **Startups that solve a problem are more likely to get funding from investors.** Investors are more likely to invest in startups that are solving a problem because they believe that these startups have a better chance of being successful.

Here are some tips for building a startup that solves a problem:

1.  **Find a problem that people are willing to pay to solve.** Not all problems are created equal. Some problems are more important to people than others. Make sure that you are solving a problem that people are willing to pay to solve.
2.  **Create a solution that is better than anything else that is currently available.** Your solution should be easy to use, affordable, and effective.
3.  **Get feedback from potential users.** As you are developing your solution, get feedback from potential users. This will help you to identify any problems with your solution and make sure that it is meeting the needs of your users.
4.  **Be persistent.** Building a startup is hard work. There will be times when you want to give up. Don’t give up. Keep working hard and eventually you will be successful.

Here are some examples of startups that have been successful by solving problems:

*   **Airbnb:** Airbnb was founded in 2008 by two roommates who were looking for a way to make some extra money. They realized that there were a lot of people who were traveling and looking for a place to stay, but who didn’t want to stay in a hotel. Airbnb created a platform that allowed people to rent out their homes to travelers. The company quickly grew and is now worth billions of dollars.
*   **Uber:** Uber was founded in 2009 by two entrepreneurs who were frustrated with the taxi system in San Francisco. They realized that there was a need for a more convenient and affordable way to get around. Uber created a platform that allowed people to request rides from drivers who were using their own cars. The company quickly grew and is now worth billions of dollars.

These are just a few examples of startups that have been successful by solving problems. If you are thinking about starting a startup, keep these tips in mind.
