# Laravel Limiting Chunk Collection: How to Chunk Results from a Custom Query

<span class="dropcap-element-slot">L</span>aravel, the popular PHP framework, offers a plethora of features that make working with databases a breeze. One such feature is the ability to chunk large query results into smaller, more manageable pieces. This comes in handy when dealing with large datasets that could otherwise cause memory issues or performance bottlenecks. In this blog post, we'll explore the `chunk` method in Laravel, specifically focusing on how to chunk results from a custom query using the `chunk` method.

## What is Chunking in Laravel?

Chunking is a technique used in Laravel to process large datasets efficiently by breaking them into smaller segments or "chunks." Instead of retrieving and processing all records at once, you can fetch a specific number of records at a time and process them iteratively. This can significantly reduce memory usage and improve overall performance, especially when dealing with large database tables. Laravel provides several helpful tools for this purpose, and one of them is the `chunk` and `chunkById` methods for working with collections of records. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use these methods effectively with examples and outputs.

## Using the `chunk` Method

The `chunk` method in Laravel is available on Eloquent query builders and allows you to iterate over a large result set in a memory-efficient way. It accepts two arguments: the number of records to retrieve in each chunk and a callback function to process each chunk of records.

Let's dive into a step-by-step example of how to use the `chunk` method in Laravel.

### Creating a Custom Query

Now, let's say we want to retrieve all products from the database where the price is greater than $50. We'll create a custom query in our `Product` model:

```php
// app/Product.php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Product extends Model
{
    public function expensiveProducts()
    {
        return $this->where('price', '>', 50);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `expensiveProducts` method defines our custom query.

### Chunking the Results

To chunk the results of our custom query, we'll use the `chunk` method in a controller or a script. Here's an example of how to do this:

```php
use App\Product;

public function chunkResults()
{
    $chunkSize = 100; // Number of records to retrieve in each chunk

    Product::expensiveProducts()
        ->chunk($chunkSize, function ($products) {
            foreach ($products as $product) {
                // Process each product here
                echo "Product Name: {$product->name}, Price: {$product->price}<br>";
            }
        });
}
```

In this code:

- We specify a `$chunkSize` variable to determine the number of records to retrieve in each chunk.
- We call the `expensiveProducts` method on the `Product` model to apply our custom query.
- We use the `chunk` method with the `$chunkSize` and a callback function to process each chunk of records. Inside the callback function, you can perform your desired operations on each product.

## Understanding the `chunkById` Method

The `chunkById` method is similar to `chunk`, but it retrieves records using their primary key (usually the `id` column). This method is helpful when working with ordered datasets or when you need to process records based on their primary key.

```php
$chunkSize = 100;

Model::orderBy('id')->chunkById($chunkSize, function ($records) {
    foreach ($records as $record) {
        // Process each record here
    }
});
```

In the example above, we use `orderBy` to ensure the records are retrieved in order, and `chunkById` processes them in chunks based on their primary key.

## Conclusion

When dealing with large datasets in your Laravel application, the `chunk` and `chunkById` methods are powerful tools to help you optimize database operations, allowing you to process records in smaller, manageable chunks. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily chunk results from a custom query in Laravel and handle large datasets with ease, while avoiding memory issues and improving overall performance.
