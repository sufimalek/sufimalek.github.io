### **Apache Kafka Core Concepts**

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability. In this article, we will explore the core concepts of Kafka, along with some advanced topics, and provide examples in Golang to help you understand how to work with Kafka.

#### **1. Topics**
A **topic** in Kafka is a category or feed name to which messages are sent by producers. Topics act as logs where messages are stored and organized.

- **Key Features**:
  - Topics are split into **partitions** for scalability.
  - Topics can have one or more consumers.
  - Data in a topic is retained based on the configured retention period.

- **Example**:
  A topic named `orders` could be used to store all order-related events in an e-commerce system.

---

#### **2. Producer**
A **producer** is a client application that publishes messages to a Kafka topic.

- **Key Features**:
  - Producers can specify which partition a message should be sent to.
  - Producers can include a **message key** to direct messages to specific partitions.
  - Acknowledgment settings allow tuning between performance and reliability.

- **Example**:
  An inventory system that publishes stock updates to the `inventory` topic.

---

#### **3. Consumer**
A **consumer** is a client application that subscribes to topics and processes messages.

- **Key Features**:
  - Consumers read messages sequentially from a topic's partition.
  - Consumers keep track of their progress using **offsets**.

- **Example**:
  A billing system that processes new orders from the `orders` topic.

---

#### **4. Consumer Groups**
A **consumer group** is a group of consumers working together to process messages from a topic.

- **Key Features**:
  - Each partition in a topic is consumed by only one consumer within a group.
  - Allows horizontal scaling of message consumption.

- **Example**:
  A topic with 5 partitions can be processed by 5 consumers in a group, each consuming one partition.

---

#### **5. Partitions**
A **partition** is a unit of parallelism in Kafka topics.

- **Key Features**:
  - Each partition is an append-only log.
  - Partitions enable scalability and fault tolerance.
  - Messages within a partition are ordered.

- **Example**:
  A topic `user-logs` with 3 partitions distributes messages among three brokers, improving throughput.

---

#### **6. Offsets**
An **offset** is a unique identifier for a message within a partition.

- **Key Features**:
  - Consumers use offsets to keep track of which messages have been processed.
  - Offsets allow re-reading messages if necessary.

- **Example**:
  A consumer can start processing from offset `100` in partition `1` of a topic.

---

#### **7. Error Handling**
Error handling ensures reliable message delivery and processing.

- **Key Features**:
  - Producers handle errors like retries on failed deliveries.
  - Consumers handle errors such as message deserialization issues or processing failures.

- **Example**:
  If a consumer fails to process a message, it can log the error and retry based on the application logic.

---

### **Advanced Kafka Concepts**

#### **8. Message Keys**
A **message key** is an optional value that producers can include with each message.

- **Key Features**:
  - Determines the partition for the message.
  - Ensures ordering within a key across partitions.

- **Example**:
  In a topic `user-actions`, a key `user123` ensures all actions for `user123` are sent to the same partition.

---

#### **9. Custom Partitioning**
Custom partitioning allows producers to define logic to determine the target partition.

- **Key Features**:
  - Provides more control over data distribution.
  - Useful for ensuring specific data is always written to specific partitions.

- **Example**:
  A producer sends high-priority messages to specific partitions using a custom partitioning strategy.

---

#### **10. Brokers**
A **broker** is a Kafka server that stores topic data.

- **Key Features**:
  - Brokers manage partitions and handle read/write requests.
  - Kafka clusters consist of multiple brokers for fault tolerance.

- **Example**:
  A cluster with 3 brokers might distribute partitions of a topic `logs` among them.

---

#### **11. Replication**
Replication ensures fault tolerance by duplicating partition data across brokers.

- **Key Features**:
  - Each partition has a leader and multiple replicas.
  - Kafka automatically switches the leader to a replica if the current leader fails.

- **Example**:
  A partition with a replication factor of `3` ensures data is available even if two brokers fail.

---

#### **12. Retention Policy**
Kafka retains messages based on configured policies (time or size).

- **Key Features**:
  - Messages can be retained for a specific duration or until the topic size exceeds a limit.
  - Consumers can read older messages if they havenâ€™t been deleted.

- **Example**:
  A topic configured with a retention policy of `7 days` keeps data available for a week.

---

#### **13. Compaction**
Log compaction removes old messages with the same key, retaining only the latest value.

- **Key Features**:
  - Helps manage storage efficiently.
  - Ensures consumers always have the latest state for each key.

- **Example**:
  A topic `user-profiles` uses compaction to store only the most recent user profile updates.

---

#### **14. Streams API**
Kafka Streams API is used for processing and transforming data within Kafka.

- **Key Features**:
  - Allows building applications that consume, process, and produce messages.
  - Supports stateful operations.

- **Example**:
  A streaming application aggregates clickstream data to calculate real-time website statistics.

---

### **Summary of Use Case Examples**
- **Order Processing**: Producers publish to `orders`, consumers in a group process each order for billing and shipping.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Producers send website logs to a `logs` topic; stream processors analyze user behavior.
- **Event Sourcing**: A topic stores events for rebuilding application states when needed.
