## Six Principles

It is often called SOLID+.

### Single Responsibility Principle

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class does only one thing, and there should be one and only one reason to change the class.

### Open and close principle

Open-Close Principle (OCP)

Classes and modules should be open for extension and closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

All places that refer to the base class must be able to use its subclass objects transparently.

### Interface Segregation Principle

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A class's dependence on another class should be established on the smallest interface, and it should not depend on and know the interface it does not need.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions, abstractions should not depend on details, details depend on abstractions.

### Law of Demeter

Law of Demeter (LOD)

Only talk to your immediate friends.

Also known as the Least Knowledge Principle (Least Knowledge Principle), a class should know the least about the classes it needs to couple or call, rely on as few interfaces as possible, and each interface contains only the required methods.
