## Breaststroke

I am currently able to swim the furthest stroke.

### Essentials

* Row your hands first, then retract your legs, stretch your arms first and then kick your legs.
* Be sure to hook your feet when you move your legs, and don't retract your thighs too much.
* Take your legs back and relax, kick your legs hard, be sure to drift for a while after kicking, grasp the rhythm, don't pedal quickly and retract quickly.
* Do not stroke too much with your hands, and do not exceed your shoulders.
* Lift your head and inhale when your hands start to spread out.
